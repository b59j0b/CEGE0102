CEGE0102: Professional Skills in Civil Engineering 
GIS Coursework – Personal Map – January 2025. 
Your GIS coursework combines the work you   have   carried   outin   GIS   Practical   1   and   GIS Practical   2.   If you   have successfully completed those sessions, then   you   will   have   all the   skills   required to complete the coursework. This assessment   is   worth   15%   of the   module, CEGE0102: Professional Skills in Civil Engineering. The setting and   submission   dates   areas   follows:

Description 
Your task   is to   produce   2   maps,   pertaining to the outputs of the   GIS   Practicals.   Your   submission will   be   2   pages combined   (one for each   map).
Map 1: 
Please   make a   map of an area   of your   choice,   using   Ordnance   Survey   Mastermap   data downloaded from   Edina   Digimap collection. This   may   be the area that you   worked   on   in   GIS   Practical   1 or adifferent   area. 
Your   map should focus on   a   particular topic and   should   include   a   buffer   around   a feature   or   feature(s),   in which some other   interesting features are   shown.   Examples   include:
• Your route to UCL: Draw   a   map   of your   route   to   UCL,   perhaps   via   different   transport modes.   Draw a   buffer around the   route   and   map the coffee   shops   that you   could   visit   on your   way to   UCL
• Your daily walking or exercise route: Map   where   you   usually   travel   to   exercise,   go   grocery shopping,   meet friends etc.
• Proximity to the beach: Map the   hotels or other facilities that   are   within   a   certain   distance of the   beach   (coastline) or some   other   leisure facility.
You   are   encouraged to   be creative with your choice   of topic. Your   map   should   meet   the   following   requirements:
•          You   must   have   at   least   one   layer   for   each   vector   data   format   (i.e.   at   least   one   points   layer,   one   lines   layer   and one   polygon   layer). These can   be   manually digitised or   extracted   from   existing datasets. They   must   be of your own   creation.
•          You   must   include   relevant   map   elements,e.g.:   scale   bar   insensible   metric   units,   North   arrow,   map   legend etc.
•          You   must   include   the   appropriate   copyright   statements   for   any   data   sources   included   in   your   map.
•          You   must   include   a   buffer   or   set   of   buffers   around   specified   feature(s).
•          Consideration   of   cartographic   design   elements   must   be   evidenced   (e.g.   in   symbology).
Map 2: 
Please   produce amap showing all the towns   in   Wiltshire   that   are   within   5km   of the   M5   motorway.
•          You   must   include   relevant   map   elements,e.g.:   scale   bar   insensible   metric   units,   North   arrow,   map   legend etc.
•          You   must   include   the   appropriate   copyright   statements   for   any   data   sources   included   in   your   map.
•          Consideration   of   cartographic   design   elements   must   be   evidenced   (e.g.   in   symbology).
Marking Criteria 
All   maps will   be   marked anonymously so   please do   not   include   any   identifying   information   in   either   the   map   itself   or   the   filename.
Map   1 will   be weighted   at 80%;   Map   代 写CEGE0102: Professional Skills in Civil EngineeringHaskell
代做程序编程语言2 will   be weighted   at   20%.
In   order to achieve   a   mark   in the   First Class   band   (70+) your   mark will   meet   all   of   the specifications described   in the section above. There   will   be   no   errors   or very   few   errors   (see below). The   map title and filename for your submitted   work   will   be   sensible   and   descriptive. The submission   is electronic. You will   have to   export you   map      as   .PDF   file   so   that   the      assessor   can view   it.   Instructions for   how to do this are   included   in   the   GIS   Practical   1   handout.
All features should be identifiable and viewable at A4 size.   Try   to   imagine   your   marker   printing out the   map   and   being   unable to zoom   in.
If you only submit one   map, your   map will   be   capped   at   the   maximum   for   that   element   (i.e. 80 for   Map   1;   20 for   Map   2).
An   excellent   map   (80+)   will   meet and   exceed the specifications through excellent cartography   (good symbologies,   neat   labelling, good   use of colour etc.),   creativity   and/or   use   of additional functions or   data that   were   not   introduced   in the   practical   sessions.
Where there are elements of the   specification   missing   and/or there   are   errors   present   in   your work, your   mark will   movedown from the   First Class   band.
Errors to avoid   include,   but are   not   limited to:
•         Typographical errors   in   any of the text   present   in your   map
•          Incorrect features and   locations   displayed
•          Leaving the   blue selection   highlight ON   in your   map,   not   clearing   it   before   completion. 
•          Messy   presentation   (e.g. overlapping features or   labels,   inappropriate feature   symbology, visible data frame   edges). 
•          Not   meeting the coursework specification   (this   is a   big   one!).
•          Inappropriate   scale   bar   units   (should   be   metric and   appropriate for the scale   at which the   map   is displayed, scale   bar divisions should   be   sensible,i.e.   in   0s   and   5s).
•          Elements on the   map   not appearing   in the   legend, and   viceversa.
•         The   purpose and   message   of your   map   is   unclear.
•          Incorrect file format for submission   (file does   not   open for   the   assessor).
•          Poor filename   chosen   (needs to   be   simple,   descriptive   and   professional).
Attention to detail   is crucial   in order to   achieve the   top   grades.
Submission 
The submission consists   of two   parts:
Part   1: The   personal   map as outlined   above
Part   2: The Wiltshire   map   you created   in   practical   2
IMPORTANT: You should submit your files as images exported from ArcGIS Pro. While   on   Layout view click on the ‘Share’ tab   and then ‘Export   Layout’. The   preferred   format   is   PNG.   DO   NOT SUBMIT THE   .APRX or   .MXD   FILE.   If you   do the   marker will   not   be   able   to   open   it and you will   receive a   grade   of   zero.
Only   part   1 will   be graded.   However, if you do not upload part 2 then 10 marks will be deducted from your overall grade for this assignment. Assignments   should   be   submitted   on   Moodle. You   may either submit the two files   separately   or   place them   in   a   zipped   folder. 
Grading   is anonymous so   please do not put your name on your map.
